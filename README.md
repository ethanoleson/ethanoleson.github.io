Hi! I'm Ethan. I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, AR. 

I am a geochronologist and sedimentologist who is interested in understanding the evolution of modern and ancient sedimentary systems and their linkages to tectonic processes through the use and development of thermo/geochronologic techniques.

I primarily work on detrital and igneous zircon UPb and AHe/ZHe.
