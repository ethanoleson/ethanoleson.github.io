## Projects

I am interested mostly in the intersection of mathematics and sedimentology. 

My current projects include:

1. Evaluating the methods we use to calculate max depo age. 
2. Fine tuning LA-ICP-MS for DZ U-Pb Geochronology.
3. Tectonic Sedimentology in Patagonia, Argentina. 

I am also interested in: 

1. Mathematically modeling basin processes. 
2. Geomorphology in cave systems. 
3. Geometric properties of minerals in Thermochronology
4. Developing new chronologic techniques.
